# TaskAutomation Smart Contract

## Vision

The **TaskAutomation** smart contract facilitates decentralized task management by allowing users to post tasks with specified rewards. Workers can complete tasks and receive rewards, ensuring a transparent and trustless mechanism for automating task-based payments.

## Features

- **Post Task**:
  - Task creators can post tasks with a defined reward to incentivize workers.
- **Complete Task & Distribute Reward**:
  - Once the task is completed, the creator can verify the task and automatically transfer the reward to the worker.

## Future Scope

1. **Task Verification**:

   - Implement automated or third-party verification mechanisms to validate task completion before distributing rewards.

2. **Milestone-Based Payments**:

   - Introduce milestone-based task completion, where rewards are distributed in stages as parts of the task are completed.

3. **Multi-Task Management**:
   - Enable users to manage and track multiple tasks simultaneously, with different workers assigned to each task.

The **TaskAutomation** contract simplifies task-based payments, ensuring transparency, automation, and fairness for both task creators and workers.
